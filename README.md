Al based acoustic wave monitoring of rail defects like cracks, fracture and prediction for rail wear, quality along with other parameter.
Background: Rails are used for the movement of trains and if there are major defects in the track then accident may happen or riding comfort in train may be compromised. Rail defects such as cracks, fractures, and wear are critical issues in the railway industry, leading to safety hazards, operational disruptions, and increased maintenance costs. Early detection and prediction of these defects are essential for ensuring the reliability and safety of railway infrastructure. These defects are to be noticed while train is moving. Description: The problem statement aims to develop an Al-based acoustic wave monitoring system for the early detection of rail defects and prediction of wear and quality parameters. The system will utilize acoustic waves to transmit to the rail tracks and its pattern will be monitored. The system will be capable of distinguishing between normal operating conditions and the presence of defects or abnormal wear patterns. Expected Solution: The proposed solution will involve the development of a comprehensive acoustic wave monitoring system for railway tracks. This system will consist of transmission side and reception side. Reception side sensors would be capable of predicting the track structure, quality of the rail and distance from a central fixed point
